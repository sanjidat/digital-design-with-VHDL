# Asynchronous FIFO in VHDL
```markdown
## Overview
This project implements an **Asynchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out)** memory in VHDL. The design supports separate clock domains for read and write operations and uses Gray code pointers with double synchronization to ensure reliable operation across asynchronous boundaries.

This is a typical structure used in digital systems to buffer data between two subsystems running on different clocks, such as between an ADC and a processor or between different communication interfaces.

## Features

- **8-bit wide data**
- **8-entry depth** (configurable via `addr_width`)
- Separate read and write clocks (`rd_clk` and `wr_clk`)
- Full and Empty status flags
- Double-flop pointer synchronization to avoid metastability
- Binary-to-Gray and Gray-to-Binary conversion for safe clock-domain crossing
- Synthesizable and testbench included

## How It Works

### FIFO Pointers

- **Write pointer (`wr_ptr_bin`)** and **read pointer (`rd_ptr_bin`)** are incremented in their respective clock domains.
- These are converted to **Gray code** before being passed across domains.
- Each domain synchronizes the opposite pointer with two flip-flops:
  - `wr_ptr_gray_sync1`, `wr_ptr_gray_sync2` for read domain
  - `rd_ptr_gray_sync1`, `rd_ptr_gray_sync2` for write domain

### Full/Empty Detection

- `full`: When the next `wr_ptr_gray` equals the inverted MSBs and same LSBs of synchronized `rd_ptr_gray`.
- `empty`: When `rd_ptr_gray` equals the synchronized `wr_ptr_gray`.

### Memory Access

- Write occurs on `wr_clk` when `wr_en` is high and `full` is low
- Read occurs on `rd_clk` when `rd_en` is high and `empty` is low

## Simulation

### Clocks

- `wr_clk` period: 20 ns
- `rd_clk` period: 10 ns

### Behavior

- Asserts reset at start
- Writes 8 values (`10` to `17`) into FIFO
- Waits for pointer synchronization
- Reads 8 values back
- Observe `data_out`, `full`, and `empty` during simulation


## How to Simulate
Use Xilinx ISE, ModelSim, or Vivado:
1. Compile both `.vhd` files
2. Run simulation
3. Verify waveform

More modules will be added as I progress through the course.

This `README.md` provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to simulate the VHDL code and the testbench. 

Let me know if you'd like any additional information or improvements!
