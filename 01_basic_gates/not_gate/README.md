# NOT Gate (VHDL)
```markdown
This project demonstrates a basic **NOT Gate** (Inverter) designed in VHDL. It includes both the implementation of the NOT gate and a testbench for simulation.

## 🧠 What is a NOT Gate?

A **NOT Gate** is a digital logic gate that inverts its input. If the input is `1`, the output will be `0`, and if the input is `0`, the output will be `1`. It is also known as an **Inverter**.

### 🔍 Truth Table

| A | Output (Y) |
|---|-------------|
| 0 |     1       |
| 1 |     0       |

▶️ How to Simulate
Open your preferred VHDL simulator (e.g., Xilinx ISE, ModelSim, Vivado, GHDL).
Add both .vhd files to your project.
Run the simulation on and_gate_tb.
Observe the output waveform or console results.

## Tools Used
- VHDL (IEEE STD_LOGIC_1164)
- Xilinx ISE / ISIM (Simulation tools)
