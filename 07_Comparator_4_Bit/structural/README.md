## ?? 4-Bit Comparator

# 4-Bit Comparator (Structural VHDL - Xilinx ISE)
This project implements a **4-bit digital comparator** in **structural VHDL**, using basic logic gate components like `XNOR`, `AND`, `NOT`, and `OR`. The design was created and simulated using **Xilinx ISE**.

### ?? Objective

Compare two 4-bit binary numbers (`A` and `B`) and output:
- `G` = 1 if A > B
- `E` = 1 if A = B
- `L` = 1 if A < B

### ?? Design Summary

- **VHDL Style**: Structural
- **Components Used**: NOT, AND (2- to 5-input), OR4, XNOR
- **Tools**: Xilinx ISE, ISim
- **Testbench**: Included and simulates multiple input cases

## ?? Simulation Results

The testbench applies various input combinations to verify the comparator's functionality. Below are some sample results:

| A     | B     | G | E | L |
|-------|-------|---|---|---|
| 0100  | 1000  | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0000  | 0000  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1100  | 1000  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0110  | 0010  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1111  | 1111  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0001  | 0000  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1110  | 1110  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1100  | 0101  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
